# 🚨 SonicX – Event Rescue AI  
### Realtime Situational Awareness & Emergency Response System

SonicX Event Rescue AI is an intelligent realtime monitoring system designed to enhance safety in **events, public gatherings, crowded places, and emergency-prone environments**. The system provides instant situational awareness by detecting potential risks and sending alerts to operators through a live dashboard.

---

## 🎯 Project Purpose

Large events and crowded places often suffer from:
- Delayed incident detection  
- Lack of centralized situational awareness  
- Difficulty identifying safety threats in realtime  
- Slow communication between teams  
- Human limitations in monitoring multiple camera feeds  

SonicX aims to solve these challenges by using **AI-powered event detection**, **automated alerts**, and a **unified monitoring dashboard**.

---

## 🧠 What SonicX Does

SonicX continuously monitors environments and provides realtime alerts for:

- **Fire & Smoke**
- **Violence or Harassment**
- **Missing or Lost Person Patterns**
- **Crowd Density Surges**
- **Unusual Sound Events**
- **Emergency Button Triggers**

Instead of waiting for a human to notice an incident, SonicX immediately detects anomalies and notifies operators.

---

## 🌍 Why This System Is Needed

Events, festivals, schools, malls, and transport hubs are **high-risk locations** where:

- Injuries happen due to crowd pressure  
- Fires can spread quickly if unnoticed  
- Children or elderly people get lost  
- Fight or violence escalates without supervision  
- Emergency response teams lack immediate information

Traditional CCTV systems rely on **manual monitoring**, which is slow, inconsistent, and prone to human error.

SonicX replaces this with **automated, intelligent, real-time detection**.
